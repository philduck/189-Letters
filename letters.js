HI BWABOO when you are reading this I hope you are having a good day, and if your not (hopefully not caused by me) maybe me sharing one of my favorite memory
with you will help.
It was whenever you were here in Texas and we were outside listening to the music while watching the fireworks, I have said this before
but I truly felt at peace during that moment. So much of my worries just seemed to lift off my shoulders all at once when I was with you.

I have never felt that with anyone else, it was kind of an intense feeling, so thank you for making me feel like this.
Always yours,
Your BABY BEAR

Alright baby bear, for this letter I wanted to let you in and how I imagine our future would look like because I think it would be fun to imagine
us together.
I imagine us together in an apartment with just us, its all decorated with a big couch we have a nice living area to hang out in. We are sitting on the couch
while I have your hand over your shoulder and we are just having a fun conversation with the tv on playing in the background and our cat and dog chasing each other around the place.

I like imagining a future of us together, and it gives me a lot of comfort that that future could be a reality one day.

In this letter I just wanted to tell you how much you made me better.
You made me better by teaching me how to comfort you, even though I have a lot to learn how to comfort, I still thank you for making me a better boyfriend for you.
Also you make me better by teaching how to be more calmer and less pessimistic, I really admire that about you. I still catch myself being negative but then I think about you and how you would feel
so I try to stop myself. You also taught me how to be more open about my emotions, I am a pretty closed off guy and you have showed me that I should open up more about my emotions.

Being with you has not only made me a better boyfriend but also made me a better person, so thank you my love.

You know what song that imagine could be "our" song? I think we last chose the lily of the valley song but I also think Is it really you? song could work for us.
I just us under the stars (like that lyrics hehe) laying under a blanket or sitting in my car, with the seat all the way down looking up at the stars.
With that song in the background and to me that thought just seems so comforting, its like I look forward to it.
I wanted to do that when you came to visit but looking up in the Texas nightsky there are literally no stars.

What happened bwabo?? Hopefully its not your mom again.. I DISLIKE YOUR MOM. I hate how she treats you, no one can treat my bwabo like that. I sometimes wanna just yell at your mom.
You would never let me do that, but that stuff you tell me its like hard not to dislike her I mean come on. Anyways if it is your mom COME TO ME.
If it is about something else like stress... DONT WORRY BWABO, you got this. You are so capable and you are such a hard worker when you lock in. I am sure you will get through
whatever is stressing you bwabs dont worry I will be here to help or even be here to cheer you on.

I remember the first you made me laugh hard, we were playing that bomb game on roblox and you were trying to tell me the code to some puzzle and you went like "UHUHUH" and it we both burst out laughing.
That is one of my favorite moments with you because it was just so fun and casual that was before we started dating and we had this amazing relationship together. But, we barely knew each other and yet
we acted like we did known each other for a long time. I loved it and when I first met you everything felt so easy and we just clicked so well.

If I could replay one moment with you, I think its when we were under the fireworks on the fourth of July. or maybe it was the third I don't remember I am pretty sure it was the third right? Anyways, I want to replay that whole day with you. I think that day was like top 3 days of my life, I loved how spent that day. It made me feel "young" again I guess, us playing in the arcade and then we just walked around we even got ice cream and stuff and hungout in the front and then afterwards we went on the ferris wheel. Writing it out, this sounds like every movie date scene ever but this day was truly the best day ever for me.

The one thing that I want to experience with you for the first time is going on a road trip together.

I feel like the one thing I have noticed about you that you do (and I have definitely pointed this out in the past) but whenever your voice gets high when you are talking to me. That is usually how I know when you are happy is how high your voice is, and it makes you so cute. And the fact that you say you can't stop its like how a dog can't stop wagging its tail because its too excited, I don't know its just so cute I love your voice so much.

But then after that you became my partner in crime always trying to be with me and I realized that you being around just made everything better than without you in it and then I thought I loved you the most then.

I just wish I could make you happy all the time, you know, make you feel like I am the only person in the world that makes you happy and that you can come to me when your sad or upset. Thats why I want to make you happy, because seeing you happy makes me feel happy.

I wish you the lots of love my bwabo.`

One thing I love about our relationship is how we start our days together. We call each other either you or me (mostly you) and then one of us picks up and we yell "GOOOD MORNING BWABS" to each other and then we kiss each other, after that we tell each other about our dreams or what we saw on twitter or have a conversation or something. It seems so simple but I feel so loved at how we start our days you know? it just to me seems like the perfect way to start our days. Also at the end of our days how we say our goodnights I can't imagine doing that with anyone else. I love that we can end off our days with that note saying that we love each other and how we love our children, I especially love how I can end my days and start my days with you.

All versions of you I love but there is a few that makes my heart warm. Sleepy version of you makes me just melt, whenever you wake up and you are just whimpering it really does make my heart warm because you are like a baby when you first wake up. It just makes me want to protect you and care for you. I also
love when you get excited, you always sound so happy and cheerful like whenever I say something like suggesting we should play honor of kings you always go like "REALLY???" I can just tell your ears perk up and instantly get up and then I can just imagine your excitedly wagging.

Your voice always makes me feel calm but I remember one time, I think it was I was scared of my mom yelling at me or something I don't remember but I just needed to calm down. I remember thinking that I needed to walk around basically escaped but then you comforted me by just talking to me. I think you said something like "its okay" or something I don't remember but you changed the subject and got me focused on something else. I think your voice just makes me feel calm whenever I need to feel calm, like hearing you just talk to me about something else is just like a health potion to me as cheesy as that sounds.

But also, I think I associate fall nights to the calmness I don't know why but I think of you whenever I think of nighttime during this season, I think its because I just want to lay down under the stars with you while we are just having our fun conversations we always have during the nights that keeps us up.

There is a lot of items in my room that is like that, like all the legos you got for me especially the galaxy one we did together. Another thing, is Minnie I treat her like she needs to be protected like I was so sad when her bow got torn off because I didn't want to damage.

I know this is kind of basic but I don't know I love the idea of us parallel playing in a place that we both dreamed of getting and just enjoying our presence with each other. we both have our pets in each other laps (I have the dog and you have the cat.)

If you are like that with your family or friends, then I can only imagine what you would be like if someone talked about me. Your willingness to protect people you love is just admirable and to be honest you are a better person than I am. `

You know what amazes me about you bwabo, your memory especially when it comes to me. I think it always shocks me whenever you remember something I said a while ago or something that I said that I liked. I always think that people would forget about what I say but you, you always remember. Its like you hold those memories in a filing cabinet in your head and like you always check it and double check it or that you hold what I say to importance, that if I say something that I like or dislike it is like you have to remember. I always appreciate that, and I don't think I have ever experienced something like that I always just assume that people just forget what I have to say or I don't think that people find what I have to say important. But with you it feels like everything I have to say is notable.

Like I have said before you have always been my home, and that is all I want in a girlfriend is someone who I want to feel at home with and I think you have achieved that and then some.

That you are always watching for the next best thing and even when things get rough you still have hope. I think that is what makes you destined for greater things, even whenever you lose that hope sometimes I know you will pick yourself back up and continue forward.

It is so freeing? for some reason that I can just act like this, I think its just how I feel on the inside just that I feel like a child with you.

Sometimes I am not the calming force in your life and I am sorry for that. But you, on the other hand, you are the most calming thing in my life. From my friends, to my family, everyone in my life seems kind of stressful? maybe thats not the word but I don't feel easy around them. Whenever I am with you it, the moment you speak and say "HIII" to me instant ease. I wonder if this is how people drink their first cup of coffee in the morning. I don't know, I don't drink coffee but whenever I hear that high pitched greeting it just feels so refreshing.

I think what really makes us better than most couples is that we really just accept the weird sides of each other. This is a crude example but the fact we are so open to us touching ourselves even when we are arguing with each other. I think normally people would not allow that, but you and me are different. I think part of it is because both of us are a lot more accepting, at least in terms of each other I think with other people (especially me) we are a lot more judgmental. I think a lot of relationships there is people trying to fit into what is normal for their partner or what they think is normal in a relationship and I am glad that I am in a relationship where I don't have to worry about that, being judged by my own partner. I think I am a pretty weird person so thank you for being so accepting. `

But, after getting together with you and spending so much time in this relationship I think I have become a more hopeful person and calmer person. You taught me that I am deserving of love, that I am not really this cursed person that messes up everything they touch. I think you have definitely rubbed off on me, being a lot more calmer person about certain things but also to be a more hopeful person especially when it comes to myself.

With you though, I am constantly imagining what the future holds for us and like I said before, to me that is a comforting thought. I want to build our future with you and fulfill both of our dreams of spending our lives together.

Honestly back to the future I want to build with you, I imagine us building a wonderful home for our children. I think that is one of the things I want to achieve in our relationship is to keep building towards a home for our children, and then eventually taking care of them. Thinking about it, I can imagine little Levi watching football with us and molding him into the perfect cowboys fan while you are teaching Kaia about sudoku while the cat is with you and the dog is with me and Levi. That is just one of the many scenes I day dream sometimes. I love thinking about our little family, and I can't wait to meet Levi and Kaia. I know you are gonna be an amazing mother, I mean you were already taught what not to do pretty much. I don't know I think this is just the main goal whenever you are in a relationship is to achieve the endgame which is having a family with them.

I am telling you right now is that you don't have to worry about me, I know you worry about doing wrong by me but you forget that I am a very understanding person, especially when it comes to you. I don't look at your actions and think they are attacks on me, I know that you do not want to hurt and you always have an understandable reason for whenever you feel like you did something wrong.

But, that was really fun and I really enjoyed just sitting there talking to you and kissing you while we were building the galaxy Lego piece. I wish there was more.

I usually stare at the Lego galaxy thing and pray that thing never breaks. This might seem unreasonable but I don't want to rebuild that thing, part of it is because we threw out the instructions but also it is almost like I am overwriting your touch on it.

You know what place I want to visit with you. I want to go to the Philippines with you, actually I wish I can take you to the Philippines with me just so I can have you by my side and I know how much you are gonna miss me when I am gone. And also, I would like to travel to another country with you. I think it would be fun, just you and me and just exploring new places together. It is already fun having you around whenever I read to you and play games and screenshare to you. I can only imagine how fun it would be whenever we are visiting a country and trying new things from that country. `

I appreciate how honest you are about your feelings to me. You may think that I find it annoying or that it bothers me that I have to reassure you all the time, which I don't. I love reassuring you and turning that sad voice into that high-pitched voice that I love so much. I love how honest you are because its like I get an insight to what you are thinking about. I don't know, maybe this sound weird but its like I am reading your personal diary and you trust me to read it. I am glad for that. You shouldn't beat yourself up over the bad thoughts you have babe because those are just thoughts. Sure, you can argue that because you have those thoughts maybe there is something wrong with you but one thing about having those thoughts is that you shouldn't really punish yourself for them. like I said I love how honest you are with your feelings and I hope I can continue to hear that happy voice of yours baby girl. `

You know what I love about our arguments? The cooldown period. The part where both of our emotions start to go down and we just reflect on what happened. I think that is part of the reason why I also have hope in us. Whenever we reflect on what happened we both are trying to tackle the problem together. I am guilty of being too sad in the cooldown period and sometimes you are the person that pulls me out of that hole. I don't know I am glad we both try to find a solution and then we try to make the other person feel better and make sure the person is okay. We care about each other sooo much that we are willing to have these tough conversations, to preserve what we have. `

I at the least recognize when someone needs comfort now, so at least that is a start. I see it whenever I notice my friends open up to me and they need comfort, kind of use it as practice for you hehe. You have taught me other things like going easy on myself and stop blaming myself for little things, or things that don't matter.

I think the way we try not to dismiss each other is what makes us so special. I think I have said this before but we both care so much about the other person, and we are both deathly afraid of dismissing the other person. I know I had my moments in the past, disregarding your feelings but these days I am so afraid of accidentally disregarding you. I don't know that might sound worse than it actually is, I just don't wanna hurt you again and I feel you don't wanna hurt me in the same way. I think in other relationships I feel like they disregard each other, to the point where its just normal for them.

You don't need to like hug me or touch me in like a sexually way if you just hold my hand I would feel like I am on top of the world.

You are like a baby, and its especially cute whenever you act like a baby and bratty sometimes it is so cute. I love the fact that you act like a baby sometimes.

Or like more free if that makes sense. It is just a feeling that I didn't really know how to pinpoint other than "I like it" but thinking about it now its just more freeing around you, like with my friends its just constant jokes and like I don't know I just don't care about them I feel like I am sitting in the corner at a party around them just kind of missing out.

You are my peace baby girl. `

When I imagine our future it just gives me so much joy and happiness. Like I have said before that I cannot wait to see the future that we build together. I don't even care if its not something that we imagined, or maybe it is something that we imagined but either way I only want to have a future with you. As long as we have each other then I think we could complete and make a dream world out of anything that life throws at us as long as we have together. We can handle anything that comes our way. As long as I have you by my side then I know we can overcome anything. I love you and you are my life partner forever and always. `

I don't think we even talked about or even discussed how we just tease each other we just did it and it just so happens that we both love acting cute together. The way we do it is the same and it is amazing. I love acting cute with you and teasing you sometimes. We didn't even need to discuss it.

I should have told you that earlier. I don't remember what I imagine most of the time whenever I fall asleep, I think sometimes I imagine us exploring most a lot of places with you and I together.

Alright bwabo, I am gonna have it writing right now that we are going back here in Fort Worth for our 10 year anniversary and do everything that we did. I can imagine taking our baby kids with us and just showing them everything that we did in the past. Maybe we could build another Lego set and have our Kaia or Levi help us hehe.

I should have told you this, but every time I didn't want to draw or to go to the gym I was just reminded by that list that we wanted to accomplish by the end of the year.

I actually wanted to think about what kind of house we would live in, you know kind of think of a dream house. I told you before that I really like tight spaces and one house that is kind of like that is townhouses although I think those kind of houses you have to find them being part of a city. I can imagine our first place being like that, something small but cozy you know? but maybe not our forever home. So what I was thinking that we could be somewhat outside the city but also close to like civilization not too outside the city more like a suburbs you know? So I was thinking that a contemporary modern house would be so nice to live in or maybe even a craftsman house I think I want something that we can have a front yard and a back yard. I also want our kids to like bring their friends over or have our friends over so we can host. Those are some of my ideas for what our dream house would be like hehe but whatever we get that is fine by me as long as it is with you baby girl. `

I love our mornings bwabo, especially because its you that I am waking up with. I love waking up to you and hearing that soft baby voice of yours. I can't wait till we actually live together and we get to spend our mornings physically together. I think that I would be making us breakfast while you scroll through twitter and tell me all about the news or something that you want to complain about or talk about and then I would go and feed our dog and cat while you go get ready for work. I think that would be an amazing start to my days. I don't know why that is like the dream morning for me, but it is. I also can't wait for us to sleep in and wake up really late in the day and we both just decide to just stay in bed all day long watching movies or reading books together.

I don't think both of our families really celebrate Thanksgiving but honestly I want to start that tradition with our kids, just making a turkey and watching the Thanksgiving football game with all of us.

You said you liked rollercoasters bwabs, and I think its a shame that we didn't go to one when you were down here. We should make it a whole trip somewhere too, like we should go to Universal studios in Florida and ride all the rollercoasters at least once and then we should pick one that we both like and go on that one over and over again.

I really hope they still have our stuffed kids together like Alex and Minnie and Finn and Jerry. hehe I wonder if we continued to get tiny versions of them like different toys or puzzles or something. I love our stuffed kids bwabs. I think Minnie has become some sort of Alex towards me, like whenever I need comfort or I need to sleep I always hug her or touch in some way the same way you treat Alex.

I think the reason that I felt so at peace during that firework display with you is because I felt like I was supposed to be there? If that makes any sense at all. I don't know it felt like that I was on the right path, and for a person that has never felt like they were on the right path that is pretty important for me. It felt that was I there at the exact time, it felt right looking up at the fireworks together, it felt right holding you while watching the fireworks. It was the kind of moment that felt like it was gonna be bittersweet thinking back on it. I was already hit with a wave of nostalgia while being there.
